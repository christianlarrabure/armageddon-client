The Unofficial Armageddon Client is a client using ElectronJS, AngularJS and ExpressJS to create the ultimate MUD client for ArmageddonMUD.

# Features

- Optimized I/O for ArmageddonMUD.
- XTERM and ANSI colors.
- Visual bars to show you vital information about your character (such as health, stun, mana, focus, hunger and thirst).
- Character side bar that shows you other information about your PC (such as their name, if they are armed, etc).
- A robust note taking system (topics system) that lets you take notes and record short descriptions for Characters and Objects.
- A context side menu that detects when an object or character you have written a note about has been mentioned, and shows you a card showing you your notes on them.
- A character count to let you know when you're getting to a point where ArmageddonMUD might be cutting off your input.

# Installation Instructions

You can unzip the file appropriate for your OS and extract it in a folder you will remember the location of. Run the executable and it should automatically connect to ArmageddonMUD. Once inside, you should write \_prompt for it to set your prompt and for your visual bars to work.

It will create a data.sqlite file which is where your data is stored.

Make sure to write _prompt upon logging in.

## Windows Executable (Setup.exe)

Click on Setup.exe then pin the app when it launches it so that you can just quick run it next time. When you run it, it will create data.sqlite. Do not delete that unless you want to lose your data.
